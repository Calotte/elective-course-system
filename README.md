# elective-course-system
The Students' Lottery System is divided into pre-selection and elective courses. 
In the pre-selected phrase, the capacity of each course is unrestricted. 
After the end of the elective course, the students of the elective course will be processed. 
For different course, we can add the probability of signing for some students based on their profession. 
And the result will be written to Database.
